### Inline Code and Code Blocks 
To include a small piece of code within a line, use **inline code**. For example, in Python, the `print` function outputs text to the console. You write it as `print("Hello, World!")`.

For larger sections of code, use **code blocks**. You can create a code block by surrounding your code with triple backticks (```` ``` ````).
